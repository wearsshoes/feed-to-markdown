<p>In a significant step forward for digital preservation, Google Search is now making it easier than ever to access the past. Starting today, users everywhere can view archived versions of webpages directly through Google Search, with a simple link to the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How It Works</strong></h2>



<p>To access this new feature, conduct a search on <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> as usual. Next to each search result, you’ll find three dots—clicking on these will bring up the &#8220;About this Result&#8221; panel. Within this panel, select &#8220;More About This Page&#8221; to reveal a link to the Wayback Machine page for that website.</p>



<p>Through this direct link, you’ll be able to view previous versions of a webpage via the Wayback Machine, offering a snapshot of how it appeared at different points in time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Commitment to Preservation</strong></h2>



<p>At the Internet Archive, our mission is to provide, “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” The Wayback Machine, one of our best-known services, provides access to billions of archived webpages, ensuring that the digital record remains accessible for future generations.</p>



<p>As Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“The web is aging, and with it, countless URLs now lead to digital ghosts. Businesses fold, governments shift, disasters strike, and content management systems evolve—all erasing swaths of online history. Sometimes, creators themselves hit delete, or bow to political pressure. Enter the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine: for more than 25 years, it&#8217;s been preserving snapshots of the public web. This digital time capsule transforms our &#8220;now-only&#8221; browsing into a journey through internet history. And now, it&#8217;s just a click away from Google search results, opening a portal to a fuller, richer web—one that remembers what others have forgotten.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This collaboration with Google underscores the importance of web archiving and expands the reach of the Wayback Machine, making it even easier for users to access and explore archived content. However, the link to archived webpages will not be available in instances where the rights holder has opted out of having their site archived or if the webpage violates content policies.</p>



<p>For more information about the <strong>Wayback Machine</strong> and how you can explore the web’s history, visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/">https://web.archive.org/</a>.</p>

<p><em>The following interview with African folklore scholars Laura Gibbs and Helen Nde is part of our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/tag/vanishingculture/">Vanishing Culture</a> series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age.</em></p>

<p>Crafting and sharing folktales by word or performance is a long-standing tradition on the African continent. No one owned the stories. They were community treasures passed down through the generations.</p>



<p>Over time, many disappeared. The few stories that were written down enjoyed a broader audience once published. As those books were harder to find or out of print, digitized versions kept some folktales alive.</p>



<p>Laura Gibbs and Helen Nde are among researchers of African folktales who rely on digital collections to do their work. They maintain that digital preservation is essential for these rare cultural artifacts to remain accessible to the public.</p>



<p>Much of the transmission of African stories through performance has been lost. “That’s a culture that has either completely vanished or is vanishing,” said Nde, who immigrated from Cameroon to the United States.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HELEN.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HELEN.png" alt="" class="wp-image-27779" width="266" height="213" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HELEN.png 542w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/HELEN-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Helen Nde, author &amp; African folklore scholar</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In her forthcoming <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/774154/the-watkins-book-of-african-folklore-by-helen-nde/">book on African folklore</a> by Watkins Publishing (March 2025), Nde said 70% of her references were from sources she found through the Internet Archive. The Atlanta-based folklorist uses material either in the public domain or available through controlled digital lending (CDL) for her research. She also turns to the online collection to inform writing for her educational platform, <a href="https://www.mythologicalafricans.com/">Mythological Africans</a>.</p>



<p>Many books produced on the African continent by smaller publishing houses are now out of print or very expensive. Nde said without access to a library that carries these folktales, they can be forgotten.</p>



<p>“What&#8217;s tragic is that quite often those books that are so hard to get are the books that are written by people from within the culture, or African scholars,” Nde said. “They speak the languages and in some cases, remember the traditional ways the stories are told. They understand the stories in ways that people from outside the cultures cannot.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that these [African folklore] texts be not only preserved, but made accessible. With the recent ruling in the publishers&#8217; lawsuit, I fear researchers, journalists, writers and other people on or from the African continent who investigate and curate knowledge for the public have lost a valuable tool for countering false narratives.&#8221;</p><cite>Helen Nde, author</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These authors can fill in gaps from researchers with a different perspective than those who documented the stories from outside, she said, adding that’s why digital preservation is so important. While many African folklore texts are in the public domain in the United States, much of the anthropological and historical texts with commentary from both African and non-African scholars that provide the necessary context for these folktales are not, Nde said. “In many instances, these important auxiliary texts are out of print, which means access via the Internet Archive is the best way scholars not located in the West might ever be able to access them,” Nde said. “I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that these texts be not only preserved, but made accessible. With the recent ruling in the publishers&#8217; lawsuit, I fear researchers, journalists, writers and other people on or from the African continent who investigate and curate knowledge for the public have lost a valuable tool for countering false narratives.”</p>



<p>For Gibbs, online access to digitized books is critical to the volunteer work she does since retiring from teaching mythology and folklore at the University of Oklahoma. She compiled <a href="https://archive.org/details/guideafricafolktales">A Reader’s Guide to African Folktales at the Internet Archive</a>, a curated bibliography of hundreds of folktale books that she has shared with the public through the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>“For me doing my work, the Internet Archive is my library,” said Gibbs, who lives in Austin, Texas. “There are books at the Internet Archive that I can&#8217;t get at my local library or even in my local university library.&nbsp; Some of these books are really obscure. There just physically aren&#8217;t that many copies out there.”</p>



<p>Being able to check out one digital title at a time through controlled digital lending opened up new possibilities. In her research, she can use the search function with the title of a book, name of an illustrator or some other kind of detail. Now in her digital research, she can use the search function to perform work that she couldn&#8217;t do with physical books, such as keyword searches, with speed and precision. The collection also has been helpful in her recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Laurakgibbs">project at Wikipedia</a> to fill in information on African oral literature, such as proverbs and folktales.</p>



<p>“Digital preservation is not only preservation, it&#8217;s also transformation. Because when things have been digitized, you can share them in different ways, explore them in different ways, connect them in different ways,” Gibbs said. “So, I connect different versions of the stories to one another, and then I can help readers connect to all those different versions of the stories. But now, because of the publishers&#8217; lawsuit, many important African folktale collections and reference works are no longer available for borrowing at the Archive.”</p>



<p>What would it mean to lose digital access to these folktales?&nbsp; “It would be the end of my work,” said Gibbs. “My whole goal is to make the African folktales at the Archive more accessible to readers around the world by providing bibliographies, indexes, and summaries of the stories. But now the publishers are shutting down that public access.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The stories were embodied in the traditional storytellers and in their communities, and the continuity of that tradition over time has been so disrupted,” Gibbs said. “The loss is just staggering. The stories that were recorded are just a tiny fraction of the thousands of stories in the hundreds of different African languages…We can&#8217;t afford to let this kind of loss happen again in the digital world.”</p>



<p>Gibbs adds that just as museums are repatriating artifacts from colonized countries, the original stories of African countries need to be made available to their communities. “Digital libraries like the Internet Archive are a crucial way to make these stories available to African readers.”</p>



<p>Preservation of African folklore is not just important for research purposes, but also for self-exploration and reflection. When examining African folklore, Nde often asks: “What can these stories tell me about myself?” she said. “Speaking from my own experience, African folktales are an underexplored resource for understanding the cultural history of African peoples,” Nde said. “Mythology and folklore are how people make sense of themselves as people on this planet.”</p>

<p><br>This event was made possible in part by support from the <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2024/02/01/community-webs-receives-750000-grant-to-expand-community-archiving-by-public-libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mellon Foundation</a>. Held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, this year’s symposium was an opportunity for members to learn together and connect with each other. The day was organized around two workshops designed to support the community archiving and digital preservation work happening across Community Webs member institutions.</p>



<p>The first workshop, “Collective Wisdom: Collaborative Learning to Support Your Community Archiving Projects,” was taught by Natalie Milbrodt, CUNY University Archivist and co-founder of the <a href="https://queensmemory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queens Memory Project</a>. Attendees spent time working in small groups to create definitions of “Community Archiving” and reflect on some of the shared challenges and opportunities they were experiencing when engaging in community-centered work. This workshop&nbsp; emphasized the value of the collective wisdom of Community Webs members and will inform future educational opportunities. The community archives focus of this workshop also supported&nbsp; the Community Webs Affiliates Program, which encourages relationship-building among public libraries and other community-focused cultural heritage and social service organizations to broaden access to archiving tools for documenting the lives of their patrons.</p>

<p>In the second half of the day, Stacey Erdman and Jaime Schumacher of <a href="https://digitalpowrr.niu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital POWRR</a> led a “Walk the Workflow” workshop which demonstrated a step-by-step digital preservation process using a variety of free preservation tools including&nbsp; Internet Archive’s Vault digital preservation system.</p>



<p>A main goal for the symposium was to provide an opportunity for Community Webs members to connect and learn from each other. Throughout the day, attendees discussed projects, shared ideas, described lessons learned, and brainstormed possible avenues for future collaboration.</p>

<p>The following day, Community Webs members toured the Chicago Public Library Special Collections. Johanna Russ, Unit Head for Special Collections, gave a presentation about the complex, multi-year project CPL undertook to preserve and provide access to the records of the Chicago Park District. Highlights from this collection were available for attendees to view in the reading room.</p>



<p>That afternoon, the Archive-It Partner Meeting provided opportunities for Community Webs members and other Archive-It users to spend some time with Internet Archive staff to discuss topics such as strategies for capturing social media and making web archives more useful.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-27738" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-768x576.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/6-624x468.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Community Webs members view highlights from Chicago Public Library&#8217;s special collections</figcaption></figure>



<p>In-person events like this are instrumental in achieving a key goal of the program: offering opportunities for networking and professional development for Community Webs members. Internet Archive’s support for this national network of practitioners empowers their work on a local level to preserve and provide access to digital heritage sources reflecting the unique life and culture of their communities.</p>

<p><em>The following guest post from audio preservation expert George Blood is part of our <a href="https://blog.archive.org/tag/vanishingculture/">Vanishing Culture</a> series, highlighting the power and importance of preservation in our digital age.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On 78s</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/78s.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="359" src="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/78s.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13957" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/78s.jpg 700w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/78s-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></figure>



<p><em>Thomas Edison produces the first machine that can record and playback sound in 1877. The flat disc is first patented in 1888. The concept is very simple: a sound wave is captured on the record as a physical wave in the disc, most often shellac (the shell of the lac beetle). Most discs spin at approximately 78 rpm, hence the name 78s. Other speeds, such as 80, 90 and 100 rpm are not uncommon. In addition to speed, the equalization and stylus size varies – either to improve the sound or to dodge someone else’s patent. In the 1950s they slowly give way to the LP or microgroove record, though in some parts of the world they remain common well into the 1960s.</em></p>



<p>Why is it important to preserve 78rpm discs?</p>



<p>The cultural record of the 20th century is different from all other periods of human history by the presence of audiovisual recordings. Prior to 1877, there was no way to record the sound of a nursery rhyme being read at bedtime, a musical or theatrical performance, or the world around us. During the ensuing 147 years, formats came and went as technology and preferences changed. Yet for nearly half that time, 78rpm discs were the way we learned about each other and entertained the world. It was a time when the world became a much smaller place. The invention of the automobile and the airplane, the expansion of the railroads, the telephone and radio, to the dawn of the space age, 78s were there. Through 78s, we could hear traditional music from Hawaii long before it was a state. American popular music – jazz, fox trot, big bands, even the Beatles – spread out across the globe, well ahead of Hollywood, and long before television. A thousand people might attend a concert, a theater performance, a speech, or a dramatic reading by Charles Dickens. With the 78, it became possible for those experiences to be shared and repeated, and spread far and wide, not once and done.</p>



<p>The period of 78s doesn’t just parallel other historical developments. The sounds on 78s document cultural norms, performance practices, tastes, and the interests of people who, after centuries of drudgery and lives spent in the fields and hard labor, finally had free time. My mother liked to remind me that nothing tells you more about a person than what makes them laugh. The comedy routines and lyrics give us a window into a time when groups of people were preyed upon, disparaged, and disrespected in stereotypes and bigotry, which shines a mirror on how we can still do better to our fellow beings. We hear the buoyant sounds of the roaring ‘20s, a happy, hopeful time, of liberation and greed. Music borne of the heavy hand of oppression and poverty that conveys gospel, blues, and gives us jazz—all quintessentially American. On 78s, we can hear and learn of the other peoples of the world: of ragas and gamalans, performers who do not traverse great oceans, the cultures of foreign lands we could only read about. We can feel the despondency of the Great Depression in the songs that empathize with the struggles of a nation. Through 78s we can hear firsthand accounts of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the angry, vile speeches of dictators, the songs that inspired a once divided nation to pull together in a common cause against evil, to fight <em>for peace for our time</em>, for days <em>that will live in infamy</em>. Bursting out of the war to end all wars, big bands, swing, then rock n’ roll. It makes one long to hear Bach play the organ, Mozart play the piano, Paganini play the violin, or Orpheus beg for the turn of Euridice, and know, that if we preserved these 78rpm recordings, future generations will understand our joys and pains, to have a window, through sound, into the arc of history, the slow advance of progress of the human condition.</p>



<p>To remember half of <em>recorded</em> history, it is important to preserve 78rpm discs.</p>

<p>A previously lost cache of celebrity and historical interviews from a long-dormant radio show have been discovered, digitized, and made available for all.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive is now home to 53 episodes of <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">The Famous Computer Cafe</a>, a 1980s radio show about the new world of home computers. The program included computer industry news, product reviews, and interviews, and aired from 1983 through 1986 on radio stations in southern and central California.</p>



<p>The creators of The Famous Computer Cafe saved every episode on reel-to-reel tapes, but over the years the tapes were forgotten, and, ultimately, lost. Earlier this year archivist Kay Savetz recovered several of the tapes in a property sale, and recognizing their value and worthiness of professional transfer, launched a GoFundMe to have them digitized, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">made them available at Internet Archive</a> with the permission of the show’s creators.</p>



<p>While full of time-capsule descriptions of 1980s technology news, the most exciting aspect of the show has been the variety and uniqueness of the interviews. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx56qfqhKMmgaGyN6ZQ1lqaaNAohDXqgRHS1qM_vID0/edit?usp=sharing">list of people</a> that the show interviewed is a who&#8217;s-who of tech luminaries of the 1980s: computer people, musicians, publishers, philosophers, journalists. Interviews in the recovered recordings include <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=Timothy+leary&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype:%22audio%22">Timothy Leary</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-12-21_Douglas_Adams_and_Steve_Meretzky">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-11-17_Bill_Gates_and_Kazuhiko_Nishi">Bill Gates</a>, Atari’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1985-01-17_Jack_Tramiel_and_Bobby_Kotick">Jack Tramiel</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a>, and dozens of others. The recovered shows span November 17 1984 through July 12, 1985.</p>



<p>Many more of the original reel-to-reel tapes — including shows with interviews with Ray Bradbury, Robert Moog, Donny Osmond, and Gene Roddenberry — are still lost, and perhaps are still waiting to be found in the Los Angeles area.</p>



<p>The stories of how The Famous Computer Cafe was created — and saved, 40 years later —&nbsp;is explored in <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2024/08/podcast-342-the-famous-computer-cafe/">an episode of the Radio Survivor podcast</a>. The podcast interviewed show co-creator Ellen Fields and archivist Kay Savetz, providing a dual perspective of how the show was created and how it was recovered.</p>



<p>The recovery of these interviews, 40 years after their original airing, holds out hope that many more relics and treasures still await discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Episode: </strong>&#8216;Meet the man archiving Biden&#8217;s presidency&#8217;</p>



<p><strong>From POLITICO Tech:</strong> &#8220;The transition from one presidential administration to the next is generally thought to start around Election Day and end with the inauguration. But for the Internet Archive, it’s already underway. The nonprofit leads a coalition of libraries and universities that works to preserve the government’s digital history and to protect it from partisan tampering during administration changes. On POLITICO Tech, host Steven Overly discusses what it takes to archive a president with the Internet Archive’s Mark Graham.&#8221;</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://blog.archive.org/2024/08/08/coming-this-october-the-vanishing-culture-report/"><![CDATA[
<p><em>This October, we are publishing </em><strong><em>The Vanishing Culture Report</em></strong><em>, a new open access report examining the power and importance of preservation in our digital age. </em></p>



<p>As more content is created digitally and provided to individuals and memory institutions through temporary licensing deals rather than ownership, materials such as sound recordings, books, television shows, and films are at constant risk of being removed from streaming platforms. This means they are vanishing from our culture without ever being archived or preserved by libraries.</p>



<p>But the threat of vanishing is not exclusive to digital content. As time marches on, analog materials on obsolete formats—VHS tapes, 78rpm recordings, floppy disks—are deteriorating and require urgent attention to ensure their survival. Without proper archiving, digitization, and access, the cultural artifacts stored in these formats are in danger of being lost forever.</p>



<p>By highlighting the importance of ownership and preservation in the digital age, <em>The Vanishing Culture Report</em> aims to inform individuals, institutions, and policymakers about the breadth and scale of cultural loss thus far, and inspire them to take proactive steps in ensuring that our cultural record remains accessible for future generations.</p>
